## Emacs `cobol-mode.el`

The `cobol-mode.el` in this directory is forked from ELPA, with the
following changes:

* The indentation function was modified to prevent the insertion of
  spaces in the middle of the line being indented

## Superbol-mode

The other `.el` files in this directory are GNU/Emacs modes for
editing and navigating COBOL files using the SuperBOL LSP
server. These modes can be used in combination with `cobol-mode.el`.
