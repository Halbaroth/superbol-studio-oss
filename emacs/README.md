## Emacs `cobol-superbol-mode.el`

The `cobol-superbol-mode.el` in this directory is forked from the
`cobol-mode.el` mode of ELPA, with the following changes:

* The indentation function was simplified

* Minor modes have been added to switch between source formats

* Items for documentation have been added to the menu

## Emacs LSP modes for COBOL

Two minor modes are available on top of `lsp-mode` or `eglot-mode` to
use SuperBOL LSP:

* `lsp-superbol.el`

* `eglot-superbol.el`

See https://ocamlpro.github.io/superbol-studio-oss/sphinx/emacs for
